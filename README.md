# zen.private
This is some cpp codes that include many stuff, such as a music player, a server and a game engine.
It's a mixture of functions rather than a library.
You can use Zen with it's resource files included into your projects.
Not all codes can be compatible with the other, so just choose those files you need.

## resource structure
All codes are in the directory '/resource'.
We have several parts (basic, system, media...), each part contains some similar modules.
Module's directory was named like 'zen-xxx'.
In the basic part, the 'zen-string' is the string module and has some useful functions for string operations. and the 'zen-math' is a simple math library.

In some special modules, a README file is there. Take it and get more informations.

## example
Some example projects are in the directory '/example'.
